# check_page_links
Check validity of links in a given page

Quick project in jupyter notebook.

Given a link, the script will check all absolute links inside a page (i.e. links that start with "http") and print out the responses it receives.

Responses should be <Response [200]>; any other response may indicate there is a problem with the link.
